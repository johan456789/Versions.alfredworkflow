- Safari v13.1.2 (13609.3.5.1.5)
- macOS 10.13.6 (17G14019)

- The current application
- Any application on your disk

There are also several choices when retrieving the information:

- When dealing with **application** or **operating system** info:
  - **Command:** Copy and paste immediately
- When dealing with **application** info:
  - **Option:** Copy with OS information
  - **Control:** Copy with OS information and paste immediately
